## Experience
*September, 2015 - Present* : **Faber Marble Inc., 3D Designer, 3D Sculptor** (Marble Products)

* Created sculptures, furniture and other marble objects as well as marble tiles and textures to be exhibited in company's latest showroom in Istanbul. 
* These pieces are designed with mass and custom production in mind, as an exemplary display for the customers who are interested in identical or similar pieces for themselves. Utilized the client's extensive technological capabilities such as a 7 axes CNC machine, access to various kinds of different natural stones and experience in the industry in order to give birth to moving marble art and design. 
* Working with an ancient and historically used material such as marble to realize works which are relevant to our times and representative of present human experience was the main motivation. 
* Pieces created were mostly inspired by the varying natural patterns, transparency and colors of different kinds of stone. Special importance was given to create fluid and flowing details in some works in order to make the reflecting light dance in marble's glossy surface, making pieces come alive when the viewer moves around them. In some works, translucent semi-precious stone marble is illuminated from inside and likened to gemstones or crystals to point out the marvel of this natural metamorphic rock.
* Responsible for conceptualizing, engineering, 3D modeling, creating photo realistic renderings of related work and aiding the interior design team.

*October, 2014 - Present* : **Sur Doors, Lead Industrial Designer** (Security Doors)

* Created multiple collections of doors inspired by the unifying elements in the design languages of various ancient civilizations as well as the connection, divine cycle and commonality between the micro and macro planes of existence. Aimed to open new horizons in the understanding of aesthetic phenomenon, each door tricks the viewer both optically and contextually. The collection is titled "Doors of Perception" with sub-collections with different titles, each one being released slowly.
* Being the largest door manufacturer in the country with businesses all around Middle East and Europe already, Sur Doors asked for door designs which would be instant eye catchers when they are displayed in store windows and international fairs, so they can diversify their reach. They wanted to innovate with new materials, such as leather, while at the same time wanted to craft traditional materials with current techniques. They wanted the concepts to be substantial in their manifesto so it is possible to generate interesting interviews for the media. Color palate for each door design  and many color options were generated. The works had to be eco-friendly and minimize the waste. 
* Responsible for conceptualizing, engineering, 3D modeling, creating photorealistic renderings of door concepts and interviewing with the press about personal and project specific design philosophy.

*November, 2013 - August, 2014* : **Q Designs Inc., Lead Industrial Designer** (Wearable Technology)

* Worked as the sole industrial designer and design engineer to create a unique piece of wearable electronic accessory which charges your smartphone on the go.
* Engineered and designed a never-done-before piece of technology: built exterior and interior components and an innovative water-resistant hinge mechanism which can contain electronics. The hinge mechanism was patented in company's name and is considered a breakthrough invention.
* Responsible for market and material research, branding the company's “stylish utility” design philosophy, patent applications, prototyping (with MakerBot Replicator 3D printer), user testing and creating photorealistic renderings using Keyshot and Photoshop.
* QBracelet is the recipient of Golden A' Design Award 2015 in Wearable Technologies Design Category.
